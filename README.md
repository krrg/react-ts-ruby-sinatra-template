# Open S/MIME
This is project is part of a research project to make S/MIME email more usable and easily deployable within organizations.

# Goals
This project is primarily targeted at organizations wishing to easily deploy S/MIME internally.  Open S/MIME provides a convenient web interface to manage creation and revokation of certificates.  Users will be able to easily generate their own certificates for use in their email client.

## Caveats
The certificates generated by the default Open S/MIME system are self-signed.  This means that each device in the organization desiring to correctly validate the S/MIME certificates generated by this system will need to have the root certificate of the system (generated during installation of Open S/MIME) installed into their root store.
